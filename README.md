## Hi there 👋, I'am Jan Reyben Del Mundo, a 🎓BSIT student from Laguna State Polytechnic University ✨Santa Cruz Campus✨. I decided to take the IT course because it is related to my Senior High School Strand which is the 💻Information and Communications Technology(ICT)💻. The other reason is that I also wanted to make my own website specifically for gaming 🎮. I also thought that IT has a lot of job opportunities🏢 so that's why I took IT. I know this isn't going to be an easy ride but I'm willing to do it to reach success🎓.

## 🎯My Goals🎯
## - I'm currently learning Python for coding and I want to apply all of my knowledge on Python to my future websites and video games and of course make profit out of it 🤑
## - Aside from coding, I am also currently learning video editing🎥. It is a perfect marketing strategy😎 for my websites and video games.

## 🚀My Skills🚀
## - 💻Basic Coding specifically on Python, Java, HTML, CSS, PHP, and C#💻
## - 🎥Video Editing🎥
## - 📷Photo Editing📷
