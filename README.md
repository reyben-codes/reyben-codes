## Hi there 👋, I'am Jan Reyben Del Mundo, a 🎓BSIT student from Laguna State Polytechnic University ✨Santa Cruz Campus✨. I decided to take the IT course because it is related to my Senior High School Strand which is the 💻Information and Communications Technology(ICT)💻. The other reason is that I also wanted to make my own website specifically for gaming 🎮. I also thought that IT has a lot of job opportunities🏢 so that's why I took IT. I know this isn't going to be an easy ride but I'm willing to do it to reach success🎓.
